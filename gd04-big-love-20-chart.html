So today I'll go in depth on both sides of the Frank Clark trade to give it more context, and give my reason for thinking that right now it's a win-win. NOTE: I know less about the Seahawks because, well, I'm not a Seahawks fan. --- #First, the full trade: gt Chiefs get: Frank Clark, Seattle 2019 3rd rounder (84th overall) gt Seahawks get: Chief.

As a Mariner's fan in 2017 I remember being really excited about having Jarrod Dyson on the roster because even having individual players with World Series rings was exciting.

The process here is simple: Check team rosters (by Division) Check each player on the current 40-man roster (including DL players) and count the number of rings each player has. Relate number.

After glancing through the rosters and offseason plans for the 6 teams eliminated from the playoffs so far, I found an interesting common thread.

In my analysis, I tried to be as objective as possible and weigh things like production totals, possession metrics, and difficulty of deployment (zone starts, QoC, QoT) equally. With that being said, I decided not to give out an A+ in the grades since we were not able to take a step forward and close out the Bruins this year. I will also only be analyzing the possession metrics from the regular season since.

I found this game many years back, not very early in it's development but early enough to have been here for several of the big changes.
