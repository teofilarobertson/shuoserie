Distrowatch: Size (mebibytes): 525-909 Last Stable Version: 13.2 Last Release: 2014-11-04 Purpose: Desktop OS Installation Rescue Operating System: Linux Primary Language(s): English.  The Live-Cd's/Dvd's of openSUSE have a promotional effort and can be tested without changing something on the actual machine or installed operating system. Solved Thanks all. I managed to boot the iso with this grub entry: menuentry 'test.iso' { set isofile='/home/trmdi/Downloads/ISO/test.iso' loopback loop (hd0,5)$isofile linux (loop)/boot/x86_64/loader/linux root=live:CDLABEL=GeckoLinux_ROLLING_Plasma iso-scan/filename=$isofile initrd (loop)/boot/x86_64/loader/initrd. Use live-grub-stick command in place of live-fat-stick as shown in above examples if you wish to create bootable usb sticks formatted in any file systems supported by grub2, for example you can use ext3/ntfs formatted stick to create bootable USB from standard openSUSE installation Hi. I burned the live x86\_64 kde image of OpenSUSE Leap 15 onto a pendrive. It boots but ends in a terminal. I was expecting being able to use opensuse, and maybe install it with a graphicall installer. If possible openSUSE (произносится как /ˌoʊpənˈsuːzə/) — дистрибутив Linux. Был основан на дистрибутиве Slackware, однако был значительно переделан и представляет собой обособленный. 
After listening to openSUSE 13.1 review I really wanted to tryit out and install it to my laptop (which doesn't have optical drive). So I downloaded openSUSE 13.1 KDE Live and tried installing with unetbootin, with dd, using few multiboot scripts, they all failed! Is there a way to get openSUSE 13.1 KDE iso running These instructions explain how to create a bootable USB stick to install openSUSE from the LiveCD isos or from the DVD (which were originally intended for optical media). I downloaded the Tumbleweed iso in windows and created a bootable usb drive to install it on my ssd. When I get the page to choose between KDE or Gnome, I choose KDE and click Next, there it's stuck and the cursor just keeps spinning. This is also happening with opensuse live usb. Any ideas. Welcome to Studio Express. SUSE Studio and Open Build Service are merging. This is the new home for building openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise images. Hey everyone! As the title says I was curious to get some input from the community. I’ve attempted triple booting a couple of times, each time runs into the issue of the windows partition failing and my Linux partition failing to connect to any WiFi connection (without an adapter) Most of the tutorials I’ve seen are quite a few years old and don’t seem to work that well in present time (unless I’m just messing up somewhere which is possible as well.) While I don’t need windows Warnung! Wenn Sie nach dieser Anleitung ein USB-Live-Medium erstellen, hat das zur Folge, dass alle Daten auf dem USB-Speicher überschrieben werden. Hey guys I decided to switch linux world and I've heared about the yast in opensuse and it's capabilities and it feels very compiling is it Ok to use opensuse as beginner. 
Leap Get the most complete Linux distribution with openSUSE's latest regular-release version! More information. Install. So i created a bootable USB drive with the dvd img from opensuse website using unetbootin and when i restart my computer and boot to the flashdrive it goes to a basic install menu so i hit install, it goes to a command line looking screen and gets to a point where it says "udev . ok" then goes to the next line, and freezes. i have remade the bootable drive 3 times, i even redownloaded and re created the drive. I used 3 different flash drives. Same thing every time. Apache Server at opensuse.org 
Topic pretty much sums it up. I know there are guides to doing this on blogs but they differ in detail, and I dont know how dated they are etc. and I wanted to hear input from people who know and use linux on a regular basis. Thanks. Download openSUSE KDE4 Live CD - The KDE Live CD edition of the openSUSE Linux operating system for 64/32-bit architectures. Hi everyone. I looking for suggestions for found the best distro for sysadmin (Windows,Unix and more). I want change Windows for linux but i don't know the better option. Here is a new tool that provides a simple zenity based GUI frontend to live-fat-stick script. The live-fat-stick script allows you to create multi boot USB stick/HDD which has vfat partition on it without formatting or removing existing data on it, it uses whole ISO images to boot so the image. Hello everyone. Why is openSUSE slow or not fluid with most desktop environments? Testing distributions such as KDE neon, Xubuntu, Antergos, Arch or Debian, Plasma and XFCE work lightly on them, instantaneously in the "answers", without any traffic jams in the animations (in Plasma) or in the opening of programs. For example, when I go to the panel calendar in Plasma, with openSUSE it usually takes a few seconds to get stuck before appearing while in KDE neon it is instantaneous, "fluid" 
Videos of talks that were given in our yearly openSUSE Conference. For upcoming conferences we will try to broadcaste the talks live on YouTube! Enjoy Hi!! Previously I've spent most of my time using GNOME, but now I'm interested in trying out one of the "lighter" and more customizable DEs. Does anyone have a recommendation for what the best options are on OpenSUSE? There's obviously a lot of patterns provided, but I'm not sure if certain options are better than others. For background, I'd prefer to stick to Gtk based (e.g. Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce) and I still want to have compositing (though I don't care if it's out-of-the-box Attenzione! Non provare a seguire procedure trovate in internet per altre distribuzioni per convertire le immagini in chiavette avviabili (unetbootin). I wanted to give openSUSE leap 15 a try, but unfortunately after a normal installation process, without any tweaks what so ever, just the standard in a none efi system, at the end i continuously get a grub error during the installation. and when I reboot, indeed i get an error, and I'm unable to enter my system. any ideas? Category: Desktop, Server, Live Medium, Raspberry Pi; Status: Active; Popularity: 9 (831 hits per day) The openSUSE project is a community program sponsored by SUSE Linux and other companies. Promoting the use of Linux everywhere, this program provides Deze pagina legt uit hoe u een USB stick kunt aanmaken, waar vanaf u een live-systeem kunt opstarten (booten), vanaf een image voor een Live CD, met andere woorden: I want to create a custom ISO of openSUSE. I was able to do this easily with the old SUSE Studio. Now, it redirects to a static page that says it's the "new home" of Studio Express or some such, and it's been that way for months. I know you can make appliances through the OBS, but there's little to no information on how to do this, and no (that I can find) sort of JeOS or other images to use as a template. Does anyone have any advice? Is the Studio Express still a WIP? Is there some other 
I tried to make a live usb by unetbootin but I couldn't. I tried to do their instruction using imagewriter but after doing that for using I've been having a lot of trouble installing Linux on this thing. I'm guessing the newer hardware is not very friendly. I think I pinned it down from the arch Wiki (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_IdeaPad_720s_(Ryzen)) that I need something with a kernel bigger than 4.15. That's really why I'm going with Antergos, it has kernel 4.15, it's supposedly fairly straight forward to install, and of course Arch and the AUR are big pluses as well. Anyway to the problem(s). For starters. openSUSE download server. This is the download area of the openSUSE distribution and the openSUSE Build Service. If you are searching for a specific package for your distribution, we recommend to use our Software Portal instead. SUSE continues to support migration from Leap to SLE,  Leap offers Live Images for the GNOME desktop. Education, Research and Health. The Leap distribution supports the health, science, research and developer communities with packages like GNU Health. As in, is it just a pre-configured oS, where all software is compatible, a la Antergos to Arch? Or is it closer to Mint gt Ubuntu? I ask because I love openSUSE SO MUCH but I prefer the MATE desktop, and setting it up from scratch is just more than I want to do (especially when Ubuntu MATE comes so nice by default). Modernize your infrastructure with SUSE Linux Enterprise servers, OpenStack cloud technology for IaaS, and SUSE's software-defined storage. Short disclaimer: I'm not a fanboy :) I know some use cases are best fit for Debian, others for openSUSE and so on. I would like just to show you one of the rare use cases where Gentoo is, my opinion, the best fit. Some times ago I needed to move some files from an iPhone to my laptop and it didn't worked as usual. A fast google search and I found out that I needed the last version of such and such libraries ( libimobiledevice ) from git HEAD because the new iOS10 etc. On a differen. This tutorial covers the process of creating a SUSE Linux USB Flash Drive using the OpenSUSE Live CD. This tutorial. SUSE includes an installation and administration program called YaST ("Yet another Setup Tool") which handles hard disk partitioning, system setup, RPM package management, online updates, network and firewall configuration, user administration and more in an integrated interface. 
The only concern I have got is my radeon 7850 ( , I've already tried opensuse 42.2 and the live dvd everything worked perfect, but once I installed I couldn't see the login (other terminals worked). So try again with opensuse because I really like kde5 or fedora? Or some other distros.
